## My bad

Sorry for some confusing choices, I actually know nothing about the neccessity of `tags\blocks` and I just made it a copy of `tags\items`.

Also, it seem that `forge:grain` and `forge:crops` didn't taken compressed counterparts into consideration. I don't know if that's true, but in my tags `byttpeter_recipe` those are counted.

## Update Log

### 1.0.1 (In development)

Theme: Bread Making

Mods Involved:

1. Farmer's Delight
   1. Cultural Delights
   2. Corn Delight
2. Exnihilo: Sequentia
3. Create

Change List:

1. [add sieve method(water logged)] wheat(`hay_block`), etc.(grain) to `farmersdelight:wheat_dough`
2. [add sieve method(water logged)] wheat(`hay_block`), etc.(grain) to `create:dough`
3. [add sieve method] wheat(`hay_block`), etc.(grain) to `create:wheat_flour`
4. [add tag] `byttpeter_recipe:grain/compressed`
5. [add tag] `byttpeter_recipe:grain`
6. [add tag] `farmersdelight:grain/compressed`
7. [add tag] `farmersdelight:grain`

Introduction:

It seems `Farmer's Delight` remove the recipe for bread. As water buckets aren't friendly for producing in the early time, I took advantage of `exnihilo` 's `sieve` to provide new methods

Explanation:

`grain` terms above refer to items tagged with `byttpeter_recipe:grain/compressed`.

`sieve` refers to those of `Exnihilo`.

### 1.0.0

Theme: Origin's Enhancement

Mods Involved:

1. Minecraft itself (None)

Change List:

1. [add recipe] name tag
2. [add recipe] elytra

Introduction:

This initial update focused on MC itself. As `name tag` is a irreplaceable thing to build something sometimes and `elytra` should be reachable for other players in multi-player game, I add recipes for them. I did not change game balance. Everything is of its rarity for it should be.
